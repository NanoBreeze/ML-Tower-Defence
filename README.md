ML-Tower Defence is a multiplayer tower defence game that leverages supervised machine learning concepts to assist players in making strategic decisions.
I made this game to learn more about Python, software design, CI, multithreading, networking, and to experiment with machine learning. 
Due to timeline constraints, the current codebase is still a beta version and will need to be refactored to improve code clarity.
